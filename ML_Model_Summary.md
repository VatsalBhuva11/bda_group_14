3. **Estimated_Market_Share** (16.0%) - Market penetration impact
4. **Avg_Engine_Size** (14.3%) - Larger engines = higher emissions
5. **Vehicle_Class_Encoded** (9.2%) - SUVs and trucks are high risk

### 🌍 Regional Hotspot Distribution
- **South America**: 50.0% hotspot rate (highest risk)
- **North America**: 41.1% hotspot rate
- **Europe Developed**: 38.7% hotspot rate
- **Oceania**: 26.7% hotspot rate
- **Asia Developed**: 20.0% hotspot rate
- **Asia Developing**: 14.0% hotspot rate (lowest risk)

### 🚗 Emission Hotspot Characteristics

## 🔮 Model Capabilities

### ✅ What the Model Can Do
1. **Predict emission hotspots** with 97.5% accuracy
2. **Identify high-risk vehicle-location combinations**
3. **Provide probability scores** for nuanced decision making
4. **Support policy planning** for emission reduction efforts

### 🎯 Example Predictions
- **High Emission Scenario**: North America + Large SUV + High CO2 → 100% Hotspot Probability
- **Low Emission Scenario**: Europe + Compact Car + Low CO2 → 0% Hotspot Probability

## 💼 Business Impact & Recommendations

### 🎯 Policy Recommendations
1. **Focus on South America and North America** - highest hotspot rates
2. **Target SUV and truck manufacturers** for stricter emission standards
3. **Incentivize smaller engine sizes** and fuel-efficient vehicles
4. **Monitor high market share** of emission-heavy vehicles

### 🔍 Implementation Strategy
1. **Use model for predictive policy planning** before implementation
2. **Regular monitoring** of regions with >50% hotspot probability
3. **Track emission trends** in identified hotspot regions
4. **Update model** with new data for improved predictions
