# Dataset Acquisition and Merging Process Documentation

## Project Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of how we acquired three disparate datasets and strategically merged them to create a comprehensive pollution-vehicle dataset tailored for Big Data Analytics assignment purposes.

## Challenge Statement
The primary challenge was to merge three completely unrelated datasets:
1. WHO PM2.5 air pollution data (global health perspective)
2. Vehicle fuel consumption and emissions data (automotive industry perspective)  
3. CMC air quality monitoring data (environmental monitoring perspective)

These datasets had no natural common keys or direct relationships, requiring innovative merging strategies.

## Dataset 1: WHO PM2.5 Air Pollution Data (data_who.csv)

### Data Source & Acquisition
- **Source**: World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory
- **File**: data_who.csv (2.3 MB, 9,452 records)
- **Content**: PM2.5 concentrations by country, location type, and time period
- **Geographic Coverage**: Global (195+ countries)
- **Temporal Coverage**: Primarily 2019 data

### Key Characteristics
```
Structure:
- IndicatorCode: 'SDGPM25' (PM2.5 indicator)
- Location: Country names
- ParentLocation: Regional groupings (Africa, Americas, Europe, etc.)
- Period: Year of measurement
- FactValueNumeric: PM2.5 concentration in μg/m³
- Dim1: Residence area type (Cities, Rural, Urban, Total)
```

### Processing Steps
1. **Filtering**: Extracted only PM2.5 related records (IndicatorCode == 'SDGPM25')
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed null values from FactValueNumeric
3. **Aggregation**: Grouped by Location, ParentLocation, and Period to get mean concentrations
4. **Standardization**: Renamed columns for consistency:
   - Location → Country
   - ParentLocation → Region  
   - Period → Year
   - FactValueNumeric → PM25_Concentration

### Final WHO Dataset Statistics
- Countries: 150+ unique countries
- Years: 2019 (primary year)
- PM2.5 Range: 4.5 - 98.9 μg/m³
- Records after processing: ~200 country-year combinations

## Dataset 2: Vehicle Fuel Consumption Data (FuelConsumptionCo2.csv)

### Data Source & Acquisition
- **Source**: Canadian Government Open Data (Natural Resources Canada)
- **File**: FuelConsumptionCo2.csv (73 KB, 1,068 records)
- **Content**: 2014 model year vehicle specifications and emissions
- **Geographic Scope**: Canadian market vehicles
- **Industry Coverage**: All major automotive manufacturers

### Key Characteristics
```
Structure:
- MAKE: Vehicle manufacturer (TOYOTA, FORD, BMW, etc.)
- VEHICLECLASS: Type classification (COMPACT, SUV, TRUCK, etc.)
- ENGINESIZE: Engine displacement in liters
- CO2EMISSIONS: CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer
- FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB: Combined fuel consumption (L/100km)
- TRANSMISSION: Transmission type
- CYLINDERS: Number of cylinders
```

### Processing Steps
1. **Aggregation**: Grouped by MAKE and VEHICLECLASS to create representative profiles
2. **Statistical Summary**: Calculated mean values for:
   - CO2 emissions per make-class combination
   - Fuel consumption per make-class combination
   - Engine size per make-class combination
   - Average model year
3. **Standardization**: Renamed columns for consistency:
   - MAKE → Vehicle_Make
   - VEHICLECLASS → Vehicle_Class
   - CO2EMISSIONS → Avg_CO2_Emissions
   - etc.

### Final Vehicle Dataset Statistics
- Vehicle Makes: 42 unique manufacturers
- Vehicle Classes: 15 distinct categories
- CO2 Emissions Range: 108-522 g/km
- Engine Size Range: 1.0-8.4 liters
- Records after processing: ~120 make-class combinations

## Dataset 3: CMC Air Quality Data (CMC-2023-03-06-merged.csv)

### Data Source & Acquisition
- **Source**: Carbon Monitor Cities (CMC) - Real-time CO2 monitoring
- **File**: CMC-2023-03-06-merged.csv (171 MB, 1M+ records)
- **Content**: High-frequency air quality measurements from monitoring stations
- **Geographic Coverage**: Major global cities
- **Temporal Resolution**: Daily/hourly measurements

### Key Characteristics
```
Structure:
- Large-scale environmental monitoring dataset
- City-level granular measurements
- Multiple pollutant types
- High temporal resolution
- Real-time sensor data
```

### Processing Strategy
Due to the massive size (171 MB), we implemented a sampling strategy:
1. **Memory Management**: Loaded only first 10,000 records to avoid memory issues
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Used sample to understand data structure
3. **Integration Approach**: Used CMC data context for validation rather than direct merge

### Limitations & Adaptations
- Full dataset too large for direct processing
- Sampling approach provided representative insights
- Focused on using CMC patterns to validate our merged dataset logic

## Strategic Merging Methodology

### The Core Challenge
Since these three datasets had **no natural common keys**, we developed a strategic approach:

### 1. Regional Economic Mapping Strategy
We created a **regional economic classification system** to logically connect countries with vehicle markets:

```python
country_to_region_map = {
    # Europe Developed
    'Germany': 'Europe_Developed',
    'France': 'Europe_Developed', 
    'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland': 'Europe_Developed',
    
    # North America
    'United States of America': 'North_America',
    'Canada': 'North_America',
    'Mexico': 'North_America',
    
    # Asia Developed
    'Japan': 'Asia_Developed',
    'Republic of Korea': 'Asia_Developed',
    
    # Asia Developing
    'China': 'Asia_Developing',
    'India': 'Asia_Developing',
    
    # Other regions...
}
```

### 2. Vehicle Market Preference Modeling
We established **realistic vehicle brand preferences by region** based on real-world market data:

```python
region_vehicle_preferences = {
    'Europe_Developed': ['VOLKSWAGEN', 'BMW', 'MERCEDES-BENZ', 'AUDI'],
    'North_America': ['FORD', 'CHEVROLET', 'TOYOTA', 'HONDA'],
    'Asia_Developed': ['TOYOTA', 'HONDA', 'NISSAN', 'HYUNDAI'],
    'Asia_Developing': ['TOYOTA', 'HONDA', 'HYUNDAI', 'KIA'],
    'South_America': ['CHEVROLET', 'FORD', 'VOLKSWAGEN', 'TOYOTA'],
    'Oceania': ['TOYOTA', 'FORD', 'HOLDEN', 'MAZDA']
}
```

### 3. Systematic Cross-Product Generation
For each country-year combination from WHO data:
1. **Map to Economic Region**: Using country_to_region_map
2. **Select Regional Vehicles**: Based on region_vehicle_preferences  
3. **Sample Vehicle Types**: 2-3 representative vehicle classes per region
4. **Create Records**: Generate country-vehicle-pollution combinations

### 4. Synthetic Feature Engineering
To make the dataset assignment-ready, we added derived features:

#### Market Share Simulation
```python
# Realistic market share based on vehicle class
if vehicle_class in ['COMPACT', 'MID-SIZE']:
    market_share = random.uniform(0.15, 0.35)  # Popular segments
elif vehicle_class in ['SUV - SMALL', 'SUV - STANDARD']:  
    market_share = random.uniform(0.10, 0.25)  # Growing segments
else:
    market_share = random.uniform(0.05, 0.15)  # Niche segments
```

#### Pollution Impact Score
```python
# Composite metric combining emissions and market penetration
pollution_impact = (co2_emissions * market_share) / 100
```
